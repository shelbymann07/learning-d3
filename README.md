# Intro to D3.js


### Setup

1. Clone this repository to a folder on your local machine. (You can use git, i.e., `git clone` or just grab the zip folder from github.)

2. Open up your terminal and navigate to the root folder of the repo you just pulled down. (Use the `cd` command to navigate the directory tree.)

3. Start up a Python simple server in the directory to help serve our scripts and data resources.

    If you have Python 2.x:

        python -m SimpleHTTPServer

    If you have Python 3.x:

        python -m http.server

4. Open your browser to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/).

5. Start scripting!
